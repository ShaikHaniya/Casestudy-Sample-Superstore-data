This is the data analytics project that I have done as a part of Project Based Learning/Internship under the IBM SkillsBuild program.
The program was brought to you by Edunet Foundaô€†Ÿon in partnership with AICTE (All India Council for Technical Education). In this project, I am going to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis on the Sample Superstore dataset.

Data set:

You can download the data from :https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bravehart101/sample-supermarket-dataset

In this dataset, we have many features like ship mode, Segment, country, City, State, Postal code, Region, category, sub-category, sales, Quantity, discount, and the Dependent variable is profit. The remaining are independent variables.

Here we will see for weak areas where there is less profit and will see how to overcome it.
