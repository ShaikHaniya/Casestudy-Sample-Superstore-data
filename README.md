# IBMProject
This is the data analytics project that I have done during the IBM aicte internship . In this project, I am going to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis on the Sample Superstore dataset.

In this dataset, we have many features like ship mode, Segment, country, City, State, Postal code, Region, category, sub-category, sales, Quantity, discount, and the Dependent variable is profit. The remaining are independent variables.

Here we will see for weak areas where there is less profit and will see how to overcome it.
